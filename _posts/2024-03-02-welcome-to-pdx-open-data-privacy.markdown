**Primary Topics of Considerations**
- Individual vs Group Privacy
- Right to be Forgotten
- Privacy Bots
- Privacy concerns of Related Data Sets (Function Creep)

**Relational Privacy**
So far privacy is an individual-based concept: what does this data reveal about this individual, what risks ensue when the `wrong' entities access it, etc. But some aspects of privacy are communal: data about one individual reveals something about other individuals or communities. Examples include genetic data, location data, and immigration status. We call this communal privacy. Moreover, it may be that data X is shareable because. But when combined with data Y, it constitutes an undue invasion of privacy for the individual. Examples include multi-modal transit data, which allows to reconstruct entire tripts to doctors' offices, etc. We call this aggregative strategy.

So when the city is considering how to set access levels and sensitivity of data ratings, it ought to consider the above two relational aspects.

In the context of the privacy challenge question 3 (a laptop gets stolen), this means that a network analysis ought to be done to understand who else's privacy is now vulnerable, and who has been the victim of a previous data breach. This is a tall order, technologically, but is not all-or-nothing.

Implementing remote wiping of data is possible today. But whether or any other technical intervention, we feel the city ought to have a resident security expert - whether they be a developer or someone who knows who to hire and maintain the code base or the third-party softwware.

Implementing remote wiping of data is possible today. So is the implementation of restricted APIs for accessing data. A practical issue is the maintenance of that software, making sure it functions correctly, (light) troubleshooting, etc. Whether this or any other technical intervention, some of us felt that the city ought to have a resident security expert(s) who is responsible for it - whether they be a developer or someone who knows who to hire and maintain the code base or the third-party software. Such a person (or persons) ought to have minimally conflicting charters, so privacy and security are not made subordinate to other considerations like economic development (important as that might be).
