**Relational privacy**
So far privacy is an individual-based concept: what does this data reveal about this individual, what risks ensue when the `wrong' entities access it, etc.
But some aspects of privacy are communal: data about one individual reveals something about other individuals or communities. Examples include genetic data, location data, and immigration status.
Moreover, it may be that data X is shareable because. But when combined with data Y, it constitutes an undue invasion of privacy for the individual. 
Examples include multi-modal transit data, which allows to reconstruct entire tripts to doctors' offices, etc.

So when the city is considering how to set access levels and sensitivity of data ratings, it ought to consider the above two relational aspects.
